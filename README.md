In today's world, effective waste management is of paramount importance. The increasing volume of waste poses significant challenges to the environment and public health. Proper waste management not only mitigates these challenges but also promotes resource reuse and recycling. The Waste Management System is a digital platform designed to streamline the process of reporting waste-related issues to municipal authorities.

### Features:

1. **Report Complaints:** Users can easily report waste or garbage problems in their vicinity to their respective municipalities through the platform.
2. **Track Complaint Status:** Users can monitor the status of their complaints and check whether they have been addressed by the authorities.
3. **Recycling Ideas:** The platform also provides information and ideas on waste recycling, fostering environmental awareness among users.

By simplifying the process of reporting waste issues, the Waste Management System aims to facilitate prompt action by municipal authorities, contributing to cleaner and healthier communities.
